# Fallfest Leaves

Fallfest Leaves colors leaves fall colors. Made for MiniFest: FallFest.

## Important notes
- Fallfest Leaves requires the Fabric mod loader and Fabric API.
- Fallfest Leaves works best when used in a new world, as any existing leaves will all be colored the same shade of red. If you generate new chunks, the leaves will be properly colored.
- Removing Fallfest Leaves should not corrupt a world. Tree generation at chunk borders may be strange, but other terrain generates correctly.
